# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

>   Using a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns, data was analyzed to find the
>   number of successful, failed, or canceled campaigns in the theater category
>   based on the month of the year that they were launched.  
>   Data was also analyzed to find the percentage of success a theater campaign
>   has based on the funding goal amount.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

>   There is a general trend of more successes than failures, with few
>   cancelations. May was the most successful month for campaigns, with 111
>   being successful. It also had the most total campaigns out of any month at
>   166, and the most failures at 52.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

>   Goals less than \$1000 are 76% successful, tapering down to 50% between
>   \$15000-\$19999. Failures overtake successes in the \$20000-24999 range, and
>   peak at an 80% failure rate when the goal amount is between \$25000-\$29999.
>   There is a 67% chance of a successful campaign if the goal is between
>   \$35000-\$44999, but there are only 6 data points in that range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

-   What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch
    Date?

    You are more likely to have a successful campaign Launching a Kickstarter In
    May would have the greatest likelihood to succeed. Launching a Kickstarter
    in December is almost just as likely to fail as it is to succeed.

-   What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    Goals under \$15000 and goals between \$35000-45000 have a better chance to
    succeed.

-   What are some limitations of this dataset?

    The data is only from a sample of 4115 Kickstarters, and a broader sample
    would give more accurate results.

-   What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
