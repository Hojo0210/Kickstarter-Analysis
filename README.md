# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	Using a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns to fund plays, data was analyzed to find the number of successful, failed, or canceled campaigns based on the month of the year that they were launched. 
	Data was also analyzed to find the percentage of success of a campaign based on the funding goal amount. 

### Purpose

	The purpose of the project was to find the relationship between the success of a play's Kickstarter campaign and the goal amount or the launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 	There is a general trend of more successes than failures, with very few cancelations. It begins to spike around April, reaching its peak in May. It tapers back down after that, finally coming to an almost even success/fail in December.


 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	Goals less than $1000 are 76% successful, tapering down to 50% between $15000-$19999. Failures overtake successes in the $20000-24999 range, and peak at an 80% failure rate when the goal amount is between $25000-$29999. There is a 67% chance of a successful campaign if the goal is between $35000-$44999, but there are only 6 data points in that range.


  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	Launching a Kickstarter In May would have the greatest likelihood to succeed. 
	Launching a Kickstarter in December is almost just as likely to fail as it is to succeed. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	Goals under $15000 and goals between $35000-45000 have a better chance to succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
